  "mystica.research.FIRST_STEPS.stage.1": "Who would have thought that the magic of an enchanting table could have transformed a blank book into this marvelous book full of mystery? This strange book seems to hint of a powerful form of arcane magic, much stronger than standard enchanting. <BR> I think I should start by studying the world around me. <BR> Maybe I can make some sort of device to aid me in examining the worldâ€¦",
  "mystica.research.FIRST_STEPS.stage.2": "Peering through the mysticometer shows a world full of flowing energy. The book calls this magic the weave. The weave seems to make up anything and everything. Each chunk seems to store a different amount of mystical energy. <BR> I wonder what else this device will reveal to me, maybe some exploration will be helpful.",

It would seem as if these threads of magic replenish the weave periodically. <BR> How they replenish the weave is still a mystery to me."
